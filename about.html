                    <h2>Who is Lawrence?</h2> 

                    <p>My name is Lawrence Sibisi, A graduate withholding a Diploma in the field of Information and Technology. I must say that I am really proud of my self for being where are am today, “in the Tech space”.</p>
                    <p>My journey is quite interesting, to think that back then I never saw myself as a software developer, DevOps engineer, Network technician or anything to do with Technology. after I matriculated All I wanted was to be a Lawyer. but Because my matric results were not that good, that dreams couldn’t come true. I took a gap year to think about what I wanted, but still that year wasn’t enough.</p>
                    <p> I took another one mostly because I was upgrading but didn’t results change just a little. So I got a job as a call center Agent for a year, and I was good at that Job, until my brother introduced IT to me. So I did my reasech about it, went to the IT guyz at the company I was working with, and I was so fascinated by “how come you write some words with characters like percentage, semicolons, etc, then it executes stuff I see when I use a computer, and make those to perform tasks”. </p>
                    <p>that’s when I realised that as much as I wanted to become a Lawyer or be in LAW, I actually felt in love with IT mostly coding. so I had to save up whilst I was still work then at the end of the year I decided that I will find an institution that will teach me IT. With my saving I then applied at Richfield , but I only did first year of my diploma because I couldn’t fund myself anymore. So I applied using my collage results at Vaal University of Technology, and Luckly I was accepted. That How I came about obtaining my Diploma in Information and Technology</p>
                    <p>I was fortunate enough that after I finished my last year at Varsity, I got a one year Internship as a DevOps intern Engineer at an amazing company Called Airvantage.  That was a kick start to my career and It was life changing. the knowledge I got there really stretched my capabilities and I fell in love with DevOps.</p>
                    <p>When the contract ended I tried applying for a few Job opportunities, learnership, internships, Coding institutions, but non of them accepted me. But I got lucky that I applied at Capaciti and I was given an opportunity to grow and up skill. As much as I was accepted for DevOps but it was replaced by Data Science. It was a bit heart breaking but I then realised that maybe this is a chance learn something different and gain more experience from the DevOps experience I have. currently I am in training as a Java Developer in Capaciti under the FNB advanced Technical Academy, and I am greatful for the opportunity.</p>
